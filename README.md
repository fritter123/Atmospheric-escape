A Python/Matlab toolkit for simulating planetary atmospheric escape via core-powered and EUV-driven mechanisms, with applications to early Earth and exoplanet studies.
This codebase is designed for researchers interested in modeling the evolution of primordial atmospheres and hydrodynamic escape processes. It includes implementations of both core-powered atmospheric escape and EUV-driven escape, allowing exploration of oxygen production, water loss, and habitability potential on rocky planets.
